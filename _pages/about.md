Turning Imagination into Structure, Narrative into World

Born in Ulsan in 2003, she developed a unique perspective by bridging the gap between logic and narrative. A self-driven creator with a passion for world-building, she integrates the precision of **Art & Technology** with the soul of **Creative Writing**. Rather than follwing a single path, she has spent her formative years synthesizing these two disciplines, seeking to design virtual environments where stories ar not just told, but lived.
